# Welcome to technical exercise of Evgenii Korotkov

The result of the work can be evaluated here: https://korotkov.me/

I decided to do part of the project in Laravel as the job requires Laravel. 
This part is an API layer between wonde api and my task. 
I have implemented several roots, actions, feints, DTO entities, collections, middleware and tests.
Of course, all this is redundant for such a small project, but I wanted to demonstrate as much as possible. 
Besides, we should always think about scaling and code cleanliness and standards.

The second part of the project is the front side. 
I will make it on pure html/css/js. 
Unfortunately, I have no experience developing any js framework.
It's here just to demonstrate.
